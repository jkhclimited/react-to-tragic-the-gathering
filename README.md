# Tragic the Gathering

Link first, explanations later.

This app was created in order to track my extensive Magic the Gathering collection, as well as be able to create decklists and see which cards from the decklist that I already own. Upon gathering all of my non-bulk cards into one location, I realized that this was going to be a tragic ordeal, as there were literally thousands of cards...hence the name that was given to this app.

## Future Features

1. "Copies owned" features in the Deckbox section
2. The ability to require multiple copies in order to slot into multiple decks
Note about 2: This is for scenarios where the user owns multiple decks and does not want to swap cards between decks on a regular basis (such as I)
